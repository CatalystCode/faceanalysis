Many times, we engineers build features without ever talking to the customers and users who they benefit. We'll start with the absolute basics: how to define your customer and discover what their true problem is. \"But I don't have any customers or users!\" you will say. You will learn how and where to find them and then how to engage them in meaningful conversation about their problems. Our goal? Build the right solution for the right customer and make them ultimately beg you for your solution. Teaching with examples, Mark will share his specific experiences finding customers and how to talk to them. We'll run through several tools, tips and tricks Mark used to find success (after years of failing).

Digital transformation leverages DevOps best practices, such as Agile Parallel Development, Continuous Delivery and Agile Operations to capitalize on opportunities and create competitive differentiation in the application economy.\nHowever, information security has been notably absent from the DevOps movement. Speed doesn’t have to negatively impact security. Container-to-container communication should not be in clear text, yet it is. So why is it so hard to implement good security practices like encryption for DevOps? The primary reason, provisioning of keys and certificates in a DevOps environment takes too long and results in bottlenecks—so people don’t use encryption unless they have to.\nIn this session we will discuss security strategies that can be implemented for CAPS (Chef, Ansible, Puppet, Salt) and Docker and how you can implement encryption easily without causing bottlenecks.",

The number of NFC tag readers may be one, two, three, four, eight, etc., and may use any known algorithm to estimate the power of the NFC tag in the game piece so the exact position may be estimated based on the relative power strength as measured by the active readers (e.g., triangulation, time difference of arrival (TDOA), etc.).\nIdentification of instructional objects, as well as the relative “micro-location” of the objects are used to select/initiate instructional content  to teach the user about combinations (e.g., multiplication tables, chemical compounds, words, etc.). For example, if it is detected that the letters “A”, “R” and “T” are present on the board, the computer application associated with the NFC readable tags in the three letters may detect their presence and position.  Another example would include chemical elements that may be included to generate complex hydrocarbon compounds used to teach the user about chemistry.\n",

There is no server. All the networking layers between the browser and the WebAPI are replaced with asynchronous callbacks. The Angular UI and the ASP.NET WebAPI are completely standard and can be tested separately from the rest of your app. So you get a well-structured application with a beautiful modern user interface and minimal overhead.

The app developer must include several popular libraries as a base just to start to build a simple app.  Now Google has expressed the same sediment.  The four App components of Android (Activities, Services, Broadcast receivers and Content providers) are not the building blocks of an Android app but a contract between the OS and Application.  App developers need to rebuild the basic building blocks whenever starting a new App.   This causes many problems for developers and leads to ambiguity about how to best build a robust App. \n <br/><br/>\nGoogle is looking to remedy this problem by releasing the Android Architectural Components (Room, Lifecycle-aware components, ViewModels and LiveData).  While they individually address developer pain points (Persist Data, Manage Lifecycles, Modular & remove errors) they also work together to implement a sane app architecture. In this talk we will detail each components functions and benefits\n  <br/><br/>\nOnce we have a clear understanding of the Architectural Components we will explain how they work together to form a robust reference architecture. Common architectural principles: The most important thing you should focus on is the separation of concerns in your app.\n <br/><br/>\nThe second important principle is that you should drive your UI from a model, preferably a persistent model.\n  <br/><br/>\nWe end the talk by reviewing how these new components replace and interact with current popular Android libraries. <br/><br/>\n",

      "description": "<p>Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. An important tenet is – services should be fine-grained and the protocols should be lightweight. This improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop and test. It also parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently and improve architecture via continuous refactoring. The microservice architecture enables continuous delivery and deployment. The Twelve-factor App methodology allows to build modern, agile, scalable and maintainable web applications.\n  <br />&#160; <br />In this talk we will provide a walkthrough of how to develop a microservices-based application and apply the twelve Factor App to refactor your application from a monolith to a micro service. Attendees will learn key architectural patterns such as Continuous Deployment, Service Discovery, Secrets management, Blue-Green Deployments to enable a micro service architecture on AWS using containers.\n\n  <br />&#160; <br />Topics include:\n\n  <br />• Micro service Architecture overview\n\n  <br />• The Twelve Factor App overview\n\n  <br />• Deep Dive on several components of AWS stack\n\n  <br />• Architectural patterns and best practices\n\n  <br />• Deployment Pipelines\n\n  <br />• Service Discovery</p>",

This is has numerous applications including Wake-on-Lan services. In 1980’s, AppleTalk was handling this scenario for Macs which are connected together with LocalTalk cabling.

This means that your web apps are going to be incredibly fast and will easily scale to millions of users. Go is an amazing choice for a server-side language as it was developed by some of the same individuals who created the C programming language and Unix, two of the most influential languages of all time.

What this talk will cover is what goes wrong cognitively when we try to design our own tools.\n<br/>\nHave you ever watched the moon rise on the horizon and thought, \"Wow! I've never seen the moon so big!\" Sorry to tell you, but the moon isn't actually bigger. The moon has the same physical size the entire time in the sky, even on the horizon. What you are experiencing is a type of ocular illusion called the moon illusion. Google it!\n<br/>\nJust like the moon illusion, there are other psychological traps we developers need to be aware of when writing dev tools. For example, color does not exist. There is no consensus what \"red\" actually looks like, because there's no way to compare our subjective experiences of what we actually see when the \"red\" wavelength hits our eyes. \n<br/>\nIn 2015 I received my Masters degree in Human Factors (UX), where I built a Kinect application to study motor learning for a kinesiology professor. I was shocked to discover the usability issues in my own project's design, considering I had studied UX for the past 3 years. Based on this feedback, I hypothesized that developer tools have usability issues because we eventually convince ourselves at the subconscious level our design is correct because it is the ideal way for us to test the tools. We think \"this design is the ideal way to use my framework!\" But in reality, this design is really the ideal way for us to test our own UI or code. \n",

Even further, my politics-chatting robot can be turned into the media information center with an opinion on virtually any subject based on the social network sentiment digesting with cognitive services.\n<br/>\nUsing the power of voice UI, mobile and cognitive services from the cloud platform, I’ll demonstrate how to securely connect and manage devices, analyze social network data, and apply cognitive services to add human-like interaction to lightweight IoT products.\n<br/>\nRobots can now understand emotions and talk to you about it.\nMy session will demonstrate how robots implemented with IBM Watson cognitive services can interact verbally with people and respond to personal emotions. In essence, I’ll show the practicalities of joining IoT-robotics with a cloud processing and mobile platform for communications. Thanks to cloud processing, anyone can use AI for the purposes of building intelligent, unmanned systems.\nToday, anyone could turn a robot vacuum into the their own personal R2D2 or C3PO. And it is not that far-fetched! ",
